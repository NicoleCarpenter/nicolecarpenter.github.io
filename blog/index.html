      <h2>My last forseeable day as a "student"
        <br>
        <small>November 12, 2015</small>
      </h2>
      <p>Tomorrow marks the last day of career week here at Dev Bootcamp. 5pm is the last time I can call myself a student, at least in the traditional sense. Come to think of it, Dev Bootcamp isn't exactly traditional education. Revision: tomorrow marks the last day of my guided education.</p>
      <p>I have basically been a student my entire life through this point. I started age 5 in kindergarten and lived and studied in the same school district through high school. I finished my senior year six months before my peers, and while the rest of my classmates were attending our Wallenpaupack Class of 2005 High School Graduation, I was in an 8 x 11 foot classroom learning the letters of the Arabic language. Through the end of last year, I was in college studying working towards one of my three degrees. And 2015 was the year of Ruby on Rails and Dev Bootcamp.</p>
      <p>Yes I am a student; it's the only way I know how to be.</p>

      <h2>Why I code

      </h2>
      <blockquote>"Why do you want to be a developer?"</blockquote>
      <p>This question seems to come up a lot on interviews. It is a different question from "Why do you want to work here?" because it speaks to something bigger than a job. It speaks to one's identity.</p>
