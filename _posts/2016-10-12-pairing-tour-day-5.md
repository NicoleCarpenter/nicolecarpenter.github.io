Day 5, still alive. 

Today was another less than optimal pairing day due to technical and scheduling difficulties. My pair, Kevin, came in a short time before lunch, and then after lunch, he discovered an issue with his Visual Studio software, so I have been sidelined all afternoon.

This morning we worked on a very normal and manageable task, even for someone like me who is not familiar with the system. Kevin works on an insurance product that allows you to get insurance quotes online. We were looking at adding a yes/no field to one of the pages of the information gathering part.
