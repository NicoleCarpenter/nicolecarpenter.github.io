title: "Clean Code: Chapter 14 - Successive Refinement"

While reading the first couple of chapters of *Clean Code*, I quickly realized that this book was going to be heavily laced with Java examples. The only moderate experience that I had with a programming language before joining 8th Light was with Ruby, and getting thrown into Java, while concurrently playing with Swift, was going to take a lot of slower paced reading for me to somewhat figure out what was going on in the code. 

Chapter 14 is the start of the example-heavy point of the book where Martin really gets deep into presenting a working feature and really getting down into the essence of the code and how he made his decisions with refactoring. Because I am not familiar with the language, I tried to follow along, but mostly I was trying to pick up on the overall design decision he was making. I also made some observations about the difference between a dynamic language like Ruby, and a static language as Java.
