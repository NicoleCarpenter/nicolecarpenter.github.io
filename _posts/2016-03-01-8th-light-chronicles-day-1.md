title: "8th Light Chronicles: Day 1"

I realize that day 1 at a new job in a new industry is probably not the most accurate way to gauge the direction of your future, but man, do I have some observations. Before I get into the technical content that shall be the focus of this blog, I want to point out how huge of a change this new world seems to be.

I cannot separate my decision to get into consulting from my decision to get into tech, because they were the same decision. Tech consulting was always what I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to be client facing, I wanted to participate in more of the business aspects besides straight coding, I wanted to learn new technologies and have constantly changing requirements, I wanted to build something meaningful to help businesses meet actual needs.

That being said, I don't know where 8th Light will fit in with all of that. It is only my first day.

Culturally, this company is probably as close to Dev Bootcamp as I will get from a real-world company. It is completely illogical how everyone here is so cool. Like, everyone. There seems to be a ton of support. There are snacks! I worked the entire day on a couch.
I would say that the only thing that I am not sure I can quickly adapt to is that there seems to be a lack of structure. People come in late and everyone seems to be gone by 5. There is a fluidity with which people operate here that I am not used to in a business setting. I think that this will likely be the biggest adjustment for me here. That and the daily blogging. So letâ€™s get to it.

Day 1 was a working out the kinks day.
