I have been at 8th Light for exactly one month. I have discovered a lot about myself in these few weeks and both questioned and championed my potential as a software developer. In the last year or so that I have been on this trajectory, I have quarrelled with the fact that I chose to pursue something that I knew would not come easy for me. From the very first time I was dropped into a C# class as a junior in college, and the endless emotions that came with that experience, I knew that this was going to be a really, really tough path.

One thing that has helped me to stay motivated and to keep learning was an article I read in my first week at a coding bootcamp entitled [*”Carol Dweck on Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset
”*](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/) that changed the way I looked at my journey. In her book, [*Mindset: The New Psychology of Success*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345472322/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0345472322&linkCode=as2&tag=thesuccha-20&linkId=6EGFRK5WESQYPNRN), and summarized in the article, Dweck speaks to how brains are malleable, able to grow and learn throughout our lifetimes. She argues that no one is born with static intelligence, creativity or character; that these things are moldable and achievable with effort, perseverance, and usually failure. The trick is, however, to use the failures as a springboard, as a learning experience to keep you moving towards your goals. 

Failing at something does not mean that I am a failure, just that I have failed. Not letting failure define me has lead me to failing way more in this field than I would have allowed myself to do with anything before in my life. I was used to being good at everything I pursued. With programming, I have had so many small meltdowns, but at the same time, I have had so many small wins. 

I look at all of the capable people around me and I am constantly reminding myself that they, too, had to start somewhere. They too have struggled. I have to also remind myself that they probably still struggle with certain aspects of their work, and that I will be right there with them when I have some experience. I don’t think that I ever expected this to get easier, but I do think that I will be able to adapt better to challenges with more tools in my tool belt. Every day I am learning and every day I am improving. I am working towards being a craftsman.
